# A DES hardware implementation in SystemVerilog

## Status of this project / Disclaimer

This project is purely educational as an experiment to learn hardware design.

Compatibility-breaking changes may occur at any time without notice.

While I do strive to implement the DES algorithm correctly and securely to the best of my knowledge,  
I explicitly give **no warranty on the correctness or security** of this implementation (see *License* for full legal disclaimer).
